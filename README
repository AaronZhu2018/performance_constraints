"Manipulator Performance Constraints on Cartesian Admittance Control for
human-robot Cooperation"

Description:
Using manipulability index to constrain the robot above a certain
threshold.

Usage:
1. Set the desired parameters for the robot and the performance
constraints
2. Run the simulation
3. View the simulated motion of the robot and the plots

Requirements:
- Robotics Toolbox for Matlab (http://www.petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html)

Notes: 
- The simulation does not consider the joint limits so the robot
might behave weird
- This code has been tested with Robotics Toolbox 9.10 and Matlab R2014a
